This project is focused on extending i3d to allow for any number of input streams. The [original code](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d) already trains streams separately, so the main contribution of this repo is to modify the training script to allow more streams, and to more easily train multiple streams. 

This code is currently a work in progress.
